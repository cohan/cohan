# Cohan Robinson

Hey! I am a web developer from the UK. I primarily use PHP (Laravel and WordPress) to build websites and web applications. I love to tinker and figure out how things work.

## Projects

### Hosted

A podcast hosting platform. All features available on all plans. Yes even that one super cool feature you like that other hosting providers put behind an enterprise level price plan.

[Host your podcast with Hosted](https://hosted.fm)

### Imgy

A simple image hosting platform. Upload an image, share a URL. Sorted.

[Use Imgy](https://imgy.org)

### WYLTR

A podcast themed after the old text adventure games. I take the role of the computer and (starting season 2) various AIs take the role of the players with a goal of seeing if the AIs can work together to finish the game.
